# Scrapwebbing

Scrapwebbing is a tool for creating a group album and sharing photos. We sisters wanted to share some photos with our parents back in Korea, but did not want to use facebook since facebook shares our photos with all of our friends. Also, we wanted to make our family scrapbook which was impossible since we live far away. We found scrawebbing could solve both problems.
